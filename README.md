# python-text-2-gif  Multithreaded Testing Branch V1.0.1

This enables you to convert gifs into python with multi-threading.

The multi threading is actually slower so it is pointless right now. 

to run enter
```
./python Text2GifGui.py
```
select a file, {filename} or input a sentence.

This will output a gif to /output/custom_single_threaded.gif if sentence is selected

or

output a gif to /output/{filename}_single_threaded0.gif and /output/{filename}_multi_threaded0.gif if a file is chosen.
